# portfire

Firing scripts, cue timing and separation distances for computer fired
pyrotechnic displays.

A portfire is the slow match a shooter holds to the fuse. This is the same job
done by a firing panel, and the part that goes wrong is never the ignition, it
is the arithmetic in front of it. A six inch shell spends about four seconds
getting to its break. Fire it on the beat and it breaks late.

## what it does

Takes a display written as a cue script, resolves it against an effect catalog
and a physical firing rig, compensates every cue for time of flight so the
break lands on the beat, checks the result against separation distance and
airspace rules, simulates the current each rail will draw, and emits the firing
table the panel actually loads.

Given the magazine book it also draws the show out of real stock rather than out
of the catalog: every cue takes a lot number, a cue whose lot has run out is
stood in with something the store actually holds, and a cue nothing can cover
stops the show being ready.

| `lint`, `fmt`, `annotate`      | working on the script itself                   |
| `distance`, `codes`, `version` | reference                                      |

## building it

```
npm install
npm test
npm run build
```

Node 20.11 or newer. No runtime dependencies.

## a warning

portfire computes timings and distances. It does not make a display safe. Every
number it produces is a starting point for a competent operator to check, and
the rules that apply where you are firing are the ones that count.
